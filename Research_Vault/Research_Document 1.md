## Introduction
When thinking about my Procedural Art redo I realized that the Half Life City that I chose didn't appeal to me at all as I barely played Half Life and I didn't care much for the style. I also drew the conclusion that it would be easier to write a research document if the city that I chose was actually interesting to me.

For this reason I chose to recreate Gotham City from the Batman comics. I realized there are a lot of versions of Gotham City so I will take whatever I can find online and combine the things together that I like. It will mostly resemble a Gotham City like in this image from the comics.

## City Layout 
The first thing that I wanted to look into was the layout of the city. Luckily for me I could find a nice map of how Gotham City is layed out:![[Gotham_map.webp]]

The first thing that I noted was how Gotham City is made up of 3 large islands with a couple of small islands attached.
